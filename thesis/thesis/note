I hope this sets a precedent for adventurers in every field.  Observe, become inspired, learn, follow your journey, then when you realize that you can make it easier for anyone to get to where you are, make that happen.  Move on, and explore more.  If we only build on our own experiences, those who are starting fresh have a lot more ground to cover.  Though their fresh perspective will be [is] a welcome one.

I suppose my undergraduate experience was me joyfully diving into a world I found interesting and enchanting.  It seems like MIT has other motives at this moment in time.
