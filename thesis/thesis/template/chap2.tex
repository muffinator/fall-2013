\chapter{Theory}
The design of a Network Sensing Algorithm requires an understanding of the networks to be analyzed.
In this thesis, the networks of interest are composed of three circuit elements: resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
The constitutive relations for these electrical circuit elements relate the voltage across an element to the current passing through it as a function of time.
In this application, it is useful to reinterpret the constitutive relations as a function of frequency by taking the Laplace Transform.


\section{RLC Elements}

Constitutive relations:
$v=iR, v=L\frac{di}{dt},$ and $i=C\frac{dv}{dt}$

\section{Frequency Domain Perspective}

Laplace transform of:\\
$v=iR, v=L\frac{di}{dt},$ and $i=C\frac{dv}{dt}$\\
$V=IR, V=LsI, I=CsV$

Impedance:\\
$Z_R=R, Z_L=Ls, Z_C=\frac{1}{Cs}$
