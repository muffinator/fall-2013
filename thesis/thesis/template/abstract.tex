A system for identifying networks of circuit elements was designed and constructed in the pursuit of better educational electronic prototyping tools.
This document contains an analysis of a circuit network identification system, with a focus on determining RLC networks using impedance sensing techniques.  
A design of both hardware and software implementations of the circuit network identification system are presented, and the results of the implementations are analyzed.
Also presented is a method for surface-mounting breadboard finger springs to printed circuit boards.



%To reduce some of the barriers that students of electrical engineering experience, I have designed and implemented a prototype breadboard that draws a schematic diagram of circuits that are built on it.
