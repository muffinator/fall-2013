\section{History of Breadboards}

The breadboard has been a staple substrate for electronic construction over the last century.
At the dawn of a growing interest in amateur radio, resourceful tinkerers used planks of wood to secure and ruggedize their electrical handiwork.
%%Breadboarding was a construction technique that enabled reconfigurable experiments or permanent electrical machines
%%---------------------------------BREADBOARD FIGURE-------------------------------
Conductive nodes, such as nails or copper rails, were driven into the non-conductive boards, providing anchors and contact points that were electrically isolated from the rest of the circuit.
Components were soldered or wire-wrapped to the nodes, and sometimes secured by non-energized nails or screws.
This construction technique provided a lot of artistic freedom in circuit construction, but was time consuming and required relatively heavy hand tools such as a hammer or drill.


\section{Modern Breadboards}

The solderless breadboard is the canonical tool given to students taking introductory courses in the field.
Rather than driving nodes into arbitrary locations, component leads are inserted into contact points arranged on a grid that allow rapid semi-rigid construction of circuits with no other tools.
%%-------------------------------BREADBOARD FIGURE-----------------------------
The layout of a solderless breadboard is designed to be compatible with a plethora of powerful integrated circuits, enabling complex electronic designs.
Modern solderless breadboards have come a long way from their namesake wooden ancestors, but there is still room for improvement.

The intent of breadboarding is to physically realize a circuit.
Often, this involves designing or using a reference schematic to guide construction, but circuit improvisation is not uncommon.  
A meticulous breadboarder can successfully realize a circuit without error by correctly placing components and jumper wires - taking care not to introduce undesired 'parasitic' components.  
However, for the uninitiated it is difficult to justify the additional time and care required to plan and build.
Inserting components and jumper wires into contact points is straightforward, but poor contacts, broken wires (inside insulation), and mis-inserting leads can plague designers for hours on end and potentially destroy components.
The shortcomings of solderless breadboards lie entirely within the art of breadboarding.
Breadboarding is a skill that is learned over time, but small errors can lead to excessive frustration and turn students off to the field.

To satisfy the requirements of the Masters in Engineering program, I propose a solution to some of the issues with the solderless breadboard.

A confident linkage between the the electrical and mechanical domains is required to construct a circuit.
On larger scales, the mechanical structures (eg. contacts, wires, components) that create electrical circuits are visible in plain sight.
It is simple and reliable, then, to determine the circuit representation of a mechanical structure that has no hidden connections.
Breadboards often obscure connections due to their construction.
The regular nature of a breadboard, a grid of contact points arranged in rails, makes it difficult to keep track of which rail is connected to what circuit node.
When combined with the opaque nature of most components and the poor reliability of breadboard contacts, visually verifying complex circuits on a breadboard becomes infeasible.
Many of the inherent problems with breadboards stem from this open-loop nature of breadboarding, where visual cues are not enough to determine the electrical circuit from the mechanical structure.
A symptom of open-loop construction techniques is a mismatch between the mental model and the physical realization of the system at hand.
I seek to close this loop by designing and implementing a circuit-sensing breadboard.

\section{Proposed Solution}

A hardware test-bench was constructed to interface with 8 rails on a breadboard.
The test-bench is composed of a pcb-mounted breadboard, an ADC and DAC multiplexing board, a microcontroller development board, firmware to control sampling and stimulating the breadboard, and software to stream the sampling data to a computer for display.
%%Effectively, the test-bench is an 8-channel digital breadboard-oscilloscope/function generator.
Since software is faster to prototype with, the theoretical circuit topology work was first implemented in software.
A circuit simulator test-bench was written to provide the circuit-sensing algorithm in development with data.
This test-bench allows the circuit-sensing algorithm to probe, stimulate, and ground every node of a randomly generated circuit, as if the circuit were built on a breadboard attached to the hardware test bench mentioned above.
The software test-bench also had the ability to print out a circuit network solution to a schematic display.


\section{Implementation to Date}

Made the software test bench, an 8-rail hardware test bench, and got the network sensing algorithm working for resistors with resistance between 100 and 5K $\Omega$.
